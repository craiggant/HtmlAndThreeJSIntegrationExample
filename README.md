# HtmlAndThreeJSIntegrationExample

This is me experimenting with some models and how they might integrate with an html web page. (Note: this project is not optimized for different sized viewports-- especially smaller devices. Rather, it is meant as an exploration/proof of concept for animation tecniques).

You can see the live example at https://html-and-three-js-integration-example.vercel.app/
